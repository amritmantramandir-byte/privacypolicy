  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Amrit Mantra Mandir develops and publishes devotional ringtone and related applications (collectively referred to as “Services”). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our apps.</p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>Our apps do not require you to register or provide personal details. However, we may use trusted third-party services, such as Google AdMob, which may collect certain non-personal information, including device identifiers, advertising IDs, and usage data to improve ad relevance and performance.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Our apps may use third-party libraries and SDKs. The main third-party service we use is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google AdMob</a> (for displaying ads)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please review the privacy policies of these third-party providers for more details.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We value your trust in using our apps. While no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, we do not collect sensitive personal information directly. All third-party integrations are configured to follow standard security practices.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our apps are designed for a general audience and are not specifically directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. Parents and guardians are encouraged to monitor app usage.</p>

    <li>You may not copy, distribute, upload, remix, resell, or use them for any commercial purpose without prior written permission from Amrit Mantra Mandir.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Unauthorized use of our content for commercial purposes may result in legal action under applicable copyright law.</p>
